Python Automation & Reporting – Multi-Tool Security Aggregation 2025
Development of a full Python module to centralize and analyze CI security reports:
• Advanced parsing ofXML/JSON reports: SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle, Dependency-Check,
Gitleaks.
• Dynamic construction ofXML schemas(streaming, iterparse, namespaces) to handle very large
files.
• Normalization of findings (file, line, severity, rule, CVSS, CWE) andglobal KPI computationper
tool.
• Full SonarQube API integration:/api/issues/search, /api/hotspots/search,
/api/qualitygates/project_status, /api/measures/component.
• Multi-source aggregation:merging vulnerabilities, hotspots, code smells, secrets, SCA
results into a uniform structure.
• Generation of anautomated executive report: summary, status (HEALTHY / ATTENTION /
BLOCKER), recommendations.
• LLM API integration (OpenAI-compatible) to enrich the report with insights and recommendations.
• Creation and email delivery of a consolidatedPDF report(PDF + text content).
• Structured logging, modular architecture (utils, details, sonar, mailer, llm_client).
Self-Managed Kubernetes Platform on Azure secured with Vault (Terraform + Ansible)2025
Step-by-step implementation of a solid foundation for web applications with isolated databases:
• Networking: Single VNet with 5 dedicated subnets — Sub1 (kube bastion), Sub2 (control-plane),
Sub3 (workers), Sub4 (DB), Sub5 (DB bastion).
• Access security: Minimal NSG rules (SSH allowed only from our public IP to the bastions; minimal
internal paths open only between required VMs).
• Provisioning: Infrastructure deployed via Terraform (network, public IPs for bastions, kube/DB
VMs). Outputs validated (public/private IPs).
• Secrets management: Operational Vault integration (AppRole) to retrieve Azure secrets and drive
Terraform through a wrapper (bash script).
• Base hardening: cloud-init applied (users/SSH keys, updates, utilities) on bastions, kube nodes
and DB VMs.
1
• K8s cluster bootstrap: prerequisites viacloud-init, orchestration viaAnsible (control-plane init,
worker join, Calico CNI);kubectl access from the bastion.
• Ansible — Caching: shared facts cached (kubeconfig,join_cmd) viajsonfile backend, reusable
across plays/runs.
• Ansible — PostgreSQL (Sub4): install + listening, CIDR ACLs (pg_hba.conf), DB/user creation,
logical backup (script+cron), smoke test (SELECT 1 ) — fully idempotent.
• DB/K8s integration: secrets delivered by Vault (AppRole), headless Services + Endpoints with
private IPs, environment variables for apps.
• Vault & AppRole (secure delivery): implementation of a secure SecretID delivery flow using
response-wrapping and Vault Agent (init/sidecar) to generate DB credentials.
• Dynamic DB credentials: issuance of temporary credentials viadatabase/creds/<role> (lease
management, rotation/renewal, DB smoke tests).
Azure Backup & Recovery with Terraform & PostgreSQL 2025
Designed and executed a full-stack backup and recovery strategy onAzure, combining
infrastructure-level snapshots with database-level Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):
• Provisioned Azure Linux VMsand managed disksusing Terraform, with explicit disk
attachments (LUN0) for persistent storage.
• Implemented disk snapshot lifecycle: created incremental snapshots, restored them as new
managed disks, and re-attached them to VMs for disaster recovery testing.
• Installed PostgreSQL 17 (PGDG)and prepared the database cluster on the persistent disk
/mnt/appdata.
• Configured WAL archivingand performedbase backupsto enable precise database recovery.
• Simulated failure by wiping the data directory and performedPoint-in-Time Recovery (PITR)using
archived WAL segments and base backups.
• Validated recovery at both layers: infrastructure (disk replacement) and application (Postgres PITR),
demonstrating end-to-end resiliency.
• Applied best practices forInfrastructure as Code (IaC), snapshot cost-awareness, and clean
resource lifecycle management withTerraform.
Azure Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform 2025
Built and managed a modular cloud environment onAzure using Terraform:
• Designed and implemented two reusable modules:network (VNet, Subnet, NSG, NIC, Public IP)
and compute (Linux VM).
• Provisioned Linux VMswith static Public IPs and cloud-init scripts to automatically install and
configure NGINX at boot time.
• Scoped all resources within dedicatedResource Groupfor isolation and lifecycle management.
• Applied environment-specific configurations(dev.tfvars, prod.tfvars) to parameterize VM size,
network CIDRs, disk size, and firewall rules.
• Implemented Network Security Groupswith environment-aware rules (SSH-only in dev, SSH +
HTTP/HTTPS in prod).
• Enforced Infrastructure as Code (IaC)practices for consistent, repeatable deployments and
simplified environment switching.
• Introduced cost awarenessby optimizing VM types, monitoring disk/IP charges, and enforcing
budget limits.
• Secured sensitive credentials throughenvironment variablesand tfvars files.
CI/CD Pipelines with GitLab CI/CD, Spring Boot, Next.js, and PostgreSQL 2025
Designed and implemented an automated CI/CD pipeline usingGitLab CI/CD:
• Automated backend build and test phases (Spring Boot) withMaven.
• Built and optimized Docker images for backend and frontend (Next.js).
• Automated deployment of applications andPostgreSQL database on a dedicated VM using Docker
Compose.
Kubernetes & GitHub Actions: Local Deployment of an LLM Agent using Ollama2025

inference.
2
• Kubernetes: Deployments and Services (backend & frontend) via cluster & resource limits.Result:
stable, observable runtime.
• CI/CD to Kubernetes: Automated GitHub workflow triggered on changes that builds and packages
the application, publishes it, updates the running environment, and verifies the rollout.Result:
predictable, low-risk releases.
• GPU acceleration: GPU-enabled inference using theNVIDIA device pluginon Kubernetes.
CI/CD and Deployment Pipelines with Jenkins and Kubernetes 2024
Designed and implemented two automated pipelines withJenkins and Kubernetes:
• Set up dedicated VMs for each ecosystem tool (Jenkins, SonarQube, ArgoCD).
• Configured NGINX as a reverse proxy to secure and centralize access.
• Implemented SSL/TLS encryptionto secure web traffic and protect sensitive data in transit.
• CI/CD pipeline: Automated builds and tests withMaven, code analysis withSonarQube, and
Docker image generation.
• Deployment pipeline: Kubernetes manifest updates and deployment viaArgoCD.
